Dear Nina,

I hear that you guys fell into bigger things!!! When is the party? Enjoy your five minutes of reprieve. Its not going to last for very long.

Hope you haven't abandoned your research yet. I just found this note I wrote about a year ago on physician migration in Uganda and some of the condidtions that may contribute to it. Given your new found interest in the subject, I will make your research easier.

You know that your people have no strategy at all for health services which continue to hamorrahage trained personeel not to western countries but to poor third world countries like Rwanda where they are better paid and have better job satisfaction!

In the late 90′s the government of Uganda sacked all junior doctors from Mulago following a strike for a living wage. It subsequently froze further recruitment for the next three years. The official line was that Uganda had more than enough doctors!

When did Ugandan ever have more than enough doctors? Whiy does the oldest medical school in Africa outside Alexandria have such problems keeping Uganda supplied with doctors? Are you aware that Makerere graduates started the medical schools in both Kenya and Tanzania?

How do you explain that other than serious policy deficits?

****************************************************** 

You are right about migrating being a personal lifestyle choice and an individual lifestyle right. You maybe aware that i did a small study in med sch (reviewed by and selected best student project by Prof. Bukenya) on the plans and choices of final year medical students.

Uganda is not the only country affected by drain. Even developed countries are always losing doctors. In Africa South Africa is one of the most developed but it also has one of the most acute brain drain problems. The UK continuously loses doctors to other anglo countries in the developed world. Canada continuously loses doctors to the US. Australia and New Zealand continuously lose doctors to the UK, Canada and the US. In general they expect that the majority of those professionals who migrate will return at some point in their career but more than 10 % are lost permanently. India and south east Asia continuously lose doctors to the west.

It is upto the states to ensure that they make their countries an attractive destination not only to their own doctors but also to those who have graduated elsewhere

It is true brain drain contributes but as Dr Lubega says, its contribution is over rated. He is wrong when he says there are less than 10 Ugandan doctors outside Uganda between 1997 and 2002. I am aware of at least 25 Ugandan doctors who graduated between 1995 and 2002 on facebook alone!

Thats because there is little guarantee that those who migrate out of Uganda would be gainfully employed in providing health services or as paediatricians. it is also important to find efficient ways of benefiting from those who have migrated and stayed within the profession. While we think about those professionasl who have migrated out of Uganda, we never talk about those resident in Uganda who have migrated out of the ranks into politics, public health and administration as well as business and private entreprise.

We never think of providing health services as a business and are trained to think of it as a vocation! Medicine as a business is not taught in medical school. But basic business skills and billable hours are part and parcel of legal training as well as engineering! Most doctors will end up providing private fee for service services as GP's or specialists. While Ugandans think of specialist only as those employed by the public hospitals are view specialists in private practice as moonlighting in areas left to nurses, medical assistants and sweepers, that is not the model elsewhere!

If you think of medical services provded by a doctor in economic terms, you will understand why a country like Uganda is short of doctors in absolute terms but not short of doctors in economic terms. Every locality or community has as many doctors as it can afford to employ. this applies to every village, township, state or country. Apart from places like Alaska and desert towns where other factors may explain why doctors chose not to live there, most other place will only employ as many doctors as the local populace can afford to provide with reasonably remunerated employment. It does not matter what the population is or the "needs", if you cannot pay doctors, you will not get doctors. So you will never get a surplus of doctors in a place like Karamoja. In places where there is a need, but the local population cannot sustain private medical services, the state has got to subsidise. In other coutries, rural and remote services are subsidised by the state even in private clinics. The medicare system where it exists pays the doctors fees but the state may top this up with bonuses to provide incentive to doctors who chose to practice in these "areas of need". The NHS or equivalent state funding pays those employed in the local hopitals.

Frequently it is the same people providing services in both systems but their employment terms allow for this unlike Uganda where it is criminalised even though it is very clear that the state cannot or will not pay a living wage to doctors it employs! What happens to "surplus doctors" -they move on to places that do not have a surplus. In the market the supply of doctors is controlled by economic "surplus and demand forces" -so Karamoja has a high demand but a low ability to pay -therefore less doctors, while Kampala has a higher but limited ability to pay so has more doctors. it also has more public hospitals so again more doctors. Plus the lifestyle choices are better than those on offer in Nakapiririt!

While there is a vocational side to being a doctor, we need to be pragmatic. In many medical schools around the world, doctors are drawn from middle class, competitive and usually not cheap schools. Education costs money. In medicine, it also costs time as training takes a very long time. In addition to a quite lengthy undergraduate degree, many doctors undergo lengthy graduate/postgraduate training costing themselves or their families a lot of money. People get to medical school because their parents invested time and money in them. Along the way, they also impart similar values to them so they too want to send their children to good scholls (read expensive in Uganda as their is no cheap school worth going to as their pass rates are abysmal and admissions to university let alone medical school zero). Individuals travelling overseas to study go through horrors unimaginable to those who stay in UG. I know doctors who have swallowed their pride to work as carers in nursing homes, cleaners, labourers, taxi drivers in foreign countries to continue their training. Of course when they specialise and do well, Ugandan politcians point at them and say -brain drain!!!

I once worked out that on my salary as a doctor in Uganda, having been the first private medical student, it would take me 20 years if I remitted all of my salary to my parents in repayment! My first admission letter from Makerere quoted fees in USD and the fees were on par with those paid by foreign students! When I first applied to a bank for a mortgage -as an intern, I was knocked back -because i was a doctor. The loan officer could not see how a doctor was going to be able to afford the repayments on a paltry 20 milion! The bank manager later because i had the chutzpah to walk into his office and demand an audience approved my loan on faith alone! He was never dissappointed -but there was no way I would have been able to repay the bank if i worked in Mulago!

There are of course other factors that make Makerere a doctor exporter medical school and Uganda a doctor exporter country. Medical programs that are more suitable to host than donor countrie mean that a Ugandan doctor is probably more confortable working in a London hospital than one in Karamoja, being of English speaking background and having completed an undergraduate course modelled on the British system makes him potentially employable and easy to intergrate into many commonwealth countries health systems! A long pedigree and long history of migration helps -my first job interview was offered me by a white Kenyan who knew all about Makerere and had worked in several Arican countries before migrating to the west. Another was arranged by a South African who had worked in Uganda for 17 years before migrating after Idi Amin kicked him out in 1972. A recent MUK graduate got his first interview after talking to me 2 weeks before his visa expired and a few phone calls and was interviewed by someone I worked with as a colleague which probably smoothed his entry into the system.

If you told me that the 120 paediatricians we have are well paid and confortable, I would think that our government considers them to be a valuable resource. Of course, Museveni will say that they cannot afford to pay you a better wage. That would be acceptable if there wasn't evidence of rampant corruption even within the ministry of health and countries like Rwanda without better resources than we do were not offering our specialists better employment terms! To me it means that someone either does not understand or does not care.
