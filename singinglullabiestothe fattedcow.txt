## Singing lullabies to the fatted cow!

June 28, 2011


Dearest Nina,

Today I was going to write about that man Apollo Kakwenzire! Then I saw that that mad man from Kigezi, Nathan has opened up a war on your daddy! I almost lent him all of my bazookas but then remembered that I may need to bring cows to Kanungu! I will hide all of my notes on Temangalo and will not share with Nathan! For today we shall talk about Kakwenzire!

You know Kakwenzire has made it his business to do Opondo’s job in cyberspace. In my last letter I suggested that his brains had been mortgaged! When one reads some of his vomit inducing stuff in support of the NRM and Museveni, one can virtually see him dancing in a tutu together with that other cheer leader, Karoro, she of the “Mbwa zirume” fame!

Kale that lady can lie! From the moment she lied about mbwa zirume, me I do not trust her! Today she produced an article in the NV that deserves a cup for being the [biggest lie of the year](http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/20/758693)! That one I will need to come back to later –am still in shock! By the way did you see how she “ate” our UBC land? “Eating” is the NRM euphemism for stealing you know. Taking something by misrepresentation is stealing you know! The lady took our land claiming she was going to build a shoe factory then put it on the market 4 days later and sold it for 350, 000 USD! Hah, what do they call that in your language! Me I overheard people on the street saying “mbu obwo bubbi bwenyini ddala, bwa kondo”!

A friend however sent me an inbox that demonstrated clearly that the man was a cynic! In fact he reminded me of a cynical article in the Independent about Museveni being a fat cow milked by sycophants who really knew that the cow was headed for disaster but continued milking it anyhow! That these people really knew what was really going on but continued to lead the fat cow to slaughter as long as it continued to produce milk for them!

That Kakwenzire man says different things in private to what he says in public! You should see his status updates! One would think that they were written by me who he claims is one of those Ugandans who are out of touch with things on the ground and are “just hating” on Museveni and the NRM!

Actually many of not all of the questions he asks have already been asked by me in one form or another! I am actually starting to think that the man is not as dumb as he sounds from his posts in public debates on FB!! Initially going by his posts I used to think they were posted by a cow from Nyabushozi!

Have you ever seen those cows? They stand in the middle of the road when you are driving and act dumb!!! Like they do not see the car or hear the horn however loud you honk!

As a matter of fact am about to sue the guy for plagiarism! The questions he asks must have been stolen from my letters to you! I know you have a soft spot for people from Nyabushozi! Have you been sharing our secrets with him? Am the only one who asks such questions!


### Electricity

Like me Kakwenzire believes that load shedding 25 years after ‘the man in the hat’ came into power is evidence of a failure to deliver and incompetence! At least me I did not vote the man on the 18th of Feb! Poor Apollo now regrets having wasted his vote on the man in the hat! Mbu he blames it on his love for the man in the hat! What else can one say! That simple common sense is not so common! That the failure of the NRM to deliver regular and reliable power 25 years after they came into power suggests that they are ignorant of the priorities and prerequisites for development and industrialisation!!! What can one say about the educated people who wasted their vote on the day they had a chance to use it wisely!!! Me I would prefer a cow from Nyabushozi! At least it knows which side of its bread is buttered and how to look after its own interests instead of exercising blind loyalty!


### Museveni’s retirement

Kakwenzire wonders when Museveni would retire and what would happen if he did! He goes on to add; “the man is almost 70 years of age, how much longer can he withstand the pressures that come with the presidency? @ Geoffrey, Museveni is a very proud person who wants to leave a legacy. I strongly believe that he will throw in the towel when people still need him. He will most likely use this term to post excellent performance and then step down in 2016. My worry is whether we shall get someone to fit in his shoes. Whether the NRM candidate will be able to defeat Besigye or Mao. If a man full of hatred like KB takes over, God knows what will happen! “, while a friend of his assures him that the man has no intention of going anywhere unless the EAC happens and he becomes president of the EAC!

At times like this my grandmother would interject with a high pitched laugh –“hi hi, kanesekere kko, muwala w’abenkima”! You will of course notice all of the sarcasm contained therein! Do these people live in la la land? How slow can a man be? A man who was an adult in 1986 and has had the benefit of 25 years of hindsight still cannot come to the realisation that this government is a waste of time? As for becoming president of the East African community, puhlease! Give me a break! That is never going to happen! Yet I have seen it repeated several times on FB by NRM cadres. Mbu the man only wants to see the EAC come to fruition and then he shall retire –to take up a place as its president! Talk about blackmail! And if it doesn’t happen, then he shall not retire! What makes them believe that the Kenyans and Tanzanians let alone the Rwandese want Museveni as their president? As for legacy, it goes without saying that if in 25 years one cannot build a legacy worthy of a honourable retirement, then I can bet that 5 more years will not deliver it! From here we can only go downhill! If KB has hatred for Museveni and the NRM, can they blame him? Has any of them been beaten, tear gassed, pepper sprayed, harassed, bundled onto pickups, had nuisance litigation and charges against them by the state or barred from going about their legal and personal business?


### Selective prosecution

Kakwenzire wonders whether its selective prosecution for Mahogany to be charged while Nasasira, Kutesa and Mbabazi are cleared! Now am sure this guy is not as stupid as he comes across when he is blindly praising the NRM! I told you that I pity you guys who have given yourselves the role of defending the NRM and Museveni for there is so much ammunition one does not even need to think to mount an offensive! For me its just a hobby and I don’t even have to waste any brain cells to come up with ready ammunition! Even better am very sure he has been sneaking a peek at my notes and my blog!!!

Seriously if you are fighting corruption, you have got to be seen to be fair and impartial! The selective prosecution of Jamwa and Bukenya is not justice! The partial treatment of the above trio, one being your daddy notwithstanding is unfair. This is how the facts of corruption get swept under the carpet in favour of emotions! This government can never be said to be serious on corruption as long as there are some untouchables who are allowed to get away with virtual murder!


## Thieving MP’s

Kakwenzire decries the fact that MP’s threw journalists out of parliament in order to discuss their own emoluments before they did a single days work (emphasis mine)! He also notes correctly that there is a problem with MP’s being allowed to decide their own emoluments as well as the immorality of the obscene amounts relative to those paid to civil servants such as teachers and doctors!

To quote Kakwenzire,

> _”Human beings are selfish by nature! Nobuwakuba oriiwe & they give u the liberty to set ur own remuneration. I think this a design problem that has to be addressed. Unfortunately it is a constitutional matter that requires amending the relevant laws kwonka it has to be done by the same MP’S still. It is ironical how opposition MP’S later turn around and criticize the gov’t for the high cost of administration or cry foul about the poor remuneration for medical personnel and/or teachers when they are giving themselves such fat salaries and allowances! “_


### Districtlets

Kakwenzire mentions the fact that the tiny district of Kiruhura will by 2016 have split up into the districtlets of Kiruhura and Kazo to accommodate tired and ageing NRM politicians who do not wish to retire! But here is where he betrays his NRM roots by dropping an oxymoron without even appearing to see the contradiction! Quote, “it’s not about age. It’s about the quality of service a leader gives his/her people”!

Seriously, what does it take or these people to see that the quality of service offered by the ageing NRM leaders is crap, pardon my French!

The creation of numerous unviable politically and financially dependent districtlets is just an extension of the state of patronage that Ugandan has become! The use of new districts to gerrymander and manipulate electorates while creating safe seats for dinosaurs is a transparent ploy! The opposition got it very wrong –the last election was rigged long before the poll!


### Fighter jets and profligacy!

Kakwenzire says, “Over 1 trillion on elections, 3bn on a swearing-in ceremony and 1.7 trillion on fighter jets in a country where 16 women die everyday trying to give life, citizens are dying of jiggers & the national referral hospital has been described as a death trap! Did we actually make the right choice on 18th Feb? “ and  ”I am not disgruntled. I am concerned & disappointed. Tell me, do u think that this is the right time for Uganda to be buying fighter jets, spend 30bn on a swearing in ceremony, increase the size of cabinet, turn each subcounty into a district etc?”

Now what can I say! The man has surely been listening even when he has been acting obtuse! Need I say more? The man has been stealing from my love letters to you! Surely he could not have come up with the above all by himself!

Now read this last bit and tell me he has not been stealing from my notes!! Quote, “jst dig out facts about jiggers. People are practically sharing accommodation with pigs & dogs yet they can not afford soap. Our fellow countrymen are suffering and the least we can do is empathise & feel for them. I agree that an airtight defence system is very crucial but the timing of this expense is miserable!”

People like Kakwenzire are not being truthful to themselves as well as fellow Ugandans. They are fully aware that the Museveni train got derailed a long time ago and is dragging us all to hell in a basket yet they adorn their tutu’s and dance to “anaza rapu”! His cheer leading captain Karoro really outdid herself in her latest article in the NV reacting to the failed states index! One could see her really dancing around and throwing her tutu off to reveal her nakedness! Why do grown men and women have to drag themselves down to that level!

Yet Kakwenzire’s own FB page suggests that he either gets it or he is coming to realise from interacting with dissenters on FB! Or is he one of those singing lullabies to the fatted cow well knowing that the emperor is naked and the cow is headed for slaughter!

I am going to send his status updates to Tinyefunza who will probably have him charged with the only offence he appears to know –treason! Then he will be taken to Nyabushoozi where he will have to run after cows for a year in bare feet as he threatened the mukiga Nathan they would do to him!!!
