[Nina Mbabazi sitting in the road](http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=178027982248634&id=712431258&ref=notif¬if_t=share_reply) has never been annoyance. I sat on the sides of the road on sunday when I could no longer walk from exhaustion. IS that arrestable?

Nina, thats arrestable behaviour going by Kulayigye's orders!

You are well known, an NRM cadre, the daughter of the super minister and married into a well known family.

For you to walk or sit by the road side may attract the attention of other people going by their own business and even incite them to join you causing a traffic jam and chaos! Even the boda boda boys would be concerned and falling all over themselves to give you a lift!

That kind of behaviour could be called terrorism and could incite people to bring the government down!

By your own admission, Kayihura's boys should be paying you a visit! You should be charged with incitement and causing chaos as well as sitting by the roadside -idel and disorderliness! Misinforming and confusing the public possibly with the intention of embarrassing the government and plotting to topple the government!

It would be good if people like Banda really listened to themselves and realised how stupid they sound when they blindly try to justify every stupidity the NRM indulges in!
