## A golden oldie; do you guys have any analysts?

Dear Nina,  
   
A friend reminded me of this letter I sent to you after the elections. In it I predicted the exact scenario that would lead to protests in kampala. At the time you returned it to me return to sender.  
   
At the time I said, quote;  
   
"The question has been asked as to whether Uganda is ripe for the Jasmine revolution. I personally don't believe it is yet but I have no doubt that it will be! Uganda has all of the hallmarks but at the moment does not have equipoise! These elections are unlikely to be the trigger! https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150092832897681 .  
   
Something else say Somalia spilling over into Uganda, another attack on the Kabaka or Omukama, A MISJUDGED HEAVY HANDED TREATMENT OF A PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION or just about anything could trigger one. Certainly Otunnu cannot trigger one even though am sure he would love to! Only Museveni can prevent a Jasmine revolution by learning from Egypt and Tunisia and pre emptying it by making clear and activating his retirement plan!"

Do you guys really have any analysts? Because as it is I seem to be doing better than all of your overpaid hacks.  
   
You know that I do really have a soft spot for you. So I really hate to tell you I told you so. Butas usual you and your government always ignore good advice.  
   
While I am saying i told you so, I will remind you that I predicted riots once Kayihura announced his strategy for combatting those who sought to walk to work -and like robots programmed to fail, the NRM machinery proceeded to self destruct.
