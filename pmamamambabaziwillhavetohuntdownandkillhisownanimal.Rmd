@Johnson Karengye Mujungu says,

"Regarding the reported hussling between President M7 and PM Mbabazi and others, and the subsquent public lashing of the later by former, which appears to be tearing Uganda's most dorminant political party apart.

What if "Sabalwanyi" is actually the one behind the reported intrigue within the party? What if? What if M7 is the one who has been building Amama's image of corruption throughout? What if?Or may be, just may be, because M7 failed to get him off the NRM SG seat, now he want's him off the PM seat? I actually think that in a way it is good that the two seperate.

I submit that Amama deserves and should be given second and fairer re-look by his party and Ugandans in general."

@Mujungu,

This game is so predictable its not funny! Allow me to play devils advocate if just for fun -serious fun!

Time for Amama Mbabazi to chose between country and his boss. it is a choice that many in the NRM will have to make for as long as museveni refuses to set a timetable for his retirement -one that does not include imposing a family member!

And only then will he ever be his own man! for three decades he has been in the shadows of his boss. he has been the right hand man and if tales be believed the hatchet man! that in essence makes him a tool!

But does an intelligent man want to forever be the tool for others dreams and aspirations for life rulership?

Amama Mbabazi will only get respect and street credibility if and when he stands up to be seen and counted and tells this nation that he was wrong. Wrong to sell the illusion of a one man dream for so long. Wrong to sell the idea that in Uganda there is only one man and no other who can pick up the baton that we could credit Museveni with having carried for 26 years going on 30, if Museveni wants that credit rather than the ignominy of not having been any better than Gadafi or Mubarak!

The NRM just like the UPC before it is a one man dream. Museveni is NRM and NRM is Museveni and just like Obote, he will bequeath it to his own family.

PM Mbabazi like Bukenya before him are just dreamers whose job is to wait upon the royal family and the emperor. They are butlers and footmen! Butlers and footmen do not get written into wills even though they may be passed on and inherited by the new scion in exchange for a retirement package and lifelong servitude!

For 3 decades and counting, Amama Mbabazi has never ever been his own man -he has always been Museveni's man! if he wants to seat at the table with his boss rather than at his feet he is going to have to challenge him.

Thats the way it has always been. Slaves only become kings by challenging and killing or exiling their king!

PM Mbabazi needs to chose which side of history he wishes to be written on!

This is Museveni's animal. As the man says, he fought (and killed for it). Under the law of the jungle, that gives him fiat to do as he wishes with the kill including deciding who gets to sit at the table and who does not. Amama just accompanied him to the hunt and saddled his steed and polished his armour and weapons!

If Amama Mbabazi wants to take possession of the animal, he is going to have to wrestle it away from the Sabalwanyi!

As for Ms Kadaga, she comes from a region that gives allegiance to the emperor even when the emperor treats them with disdain and does not even bother to drop them some crumbs and they die from jiggers!

In the wider scheme of things, she was hiding under the bed when Museveni was hunting down and killing his animal. Her people are not about to revolt if he drops her -they will just support the next person on who good fortune and the benevolence of the emperor shines!

As Museveni says, "Who is Kadaga?"
