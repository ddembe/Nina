Nina Mbabazi says, 

[_"It seems this 9th parliament may just not be as bad as we expect. By rejecting Kajura for Public service docket, rejecting Seya outright and querying the academic qualifications of two others, they are showing the executive that they will do things their way. This is going to be very interesting five years."_](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10150265521766259&id=712431258&cmntid=10150265566031259¬if_t=comment_mention)


Nina, I disagree. 

The ninth parliament defined itself by kicking journalists out so they could discuss their obscene allowances even before they had done anything at all.

These so called confirmation hearings aren't worth the time spent on them. Twelve minutes per candidate is a joke.

Furthermore the people kicked out so far are so obvious, the real question should be why they were included in the first place.

Ssebagala is a no brainer. Quite frankly if your dad agreed to serve in the same cabinet with Ssebagala, even you should doubt him. Kajura too is a no brainer -but he had to be played along with in order to avoid upsetting Banyoro. So they are given byoya byanswa to hoodwink them. 

The other two rejections are really evidence of lack of due diligence. No one who is obviously unfit by virtue of such an obvious and challengeable problem as academic qualifications should even make it to the hearing. Someone in the presidents and prime ministers office failed to do due diligence! Who draws up these lists and what are their criteria? Do they draw up the lists over a pot of malwa? i think that someone should be fired for these names having ever appeared on the list at all!

I have not caught up yet but quite frankly if Otafiire is passed by the committee for Justice, the committee should be considered a joke. Ssebagala should not be the criteria by which the quality of the committee is assessed!

The way i see it, the committee has done exactly what the executive wanted them to do -unless the executive are incompetent. The ninth parliament is yet to prove itself and so far they have started off really badly!

Ugandans need lean efficient government with the training and capacity to deliver. Listen to the new CEO of the Kampala authority speak. Now thats a woman who speaks with confidence -like she knows what she is talking about and is clear regarding her plans. The only problem is that Kampala city like the rest of Uganda is top heavy with politicians interested in posturing while being maintained at public expense and they are not likely to let her do her job. Personally I do not care for Lord Mayors and all of that sort of crap. What Kampala needed was a CEO appointed on a performance based contract with full powers and authority who does not have to waste her time placating and playing games with politicians and semi literate councillors! She also needs to have the powers to hire and fire and build her own team without interference and has got to be facilitated in doing her job.
