Dear Nina,

While trying to answer your question on policy gaps in health, I came across this note written a few years ago on Kampala's roads.

I would be grateful if you could share it with uncle Nasasira. I think he is the one who has been in charge of mimanaging our roads for now over two decades!

Intellectual dishonesty!

My friend,

You remain an inverterate spin master!!!

Where exactly did I say that there were zero roads?

I awarded marks for performance on roads and on the basis of the current statu of roads in Uganda and the NRM's record on road maintenance I awarded a mark of zero!

There is no evidence of ongoing road maintenance in Uganda! Even after the money spent /mispent onn the recent CHOGM, our roads are still crap and out road maintenance even more so!

I have lived in a number of coutries that actually have road maintenance. If what you see in kampal is evidence of road maintenance, then i do not know what the word means! you may have to redefine it!

There have been a number of donor funded road reconstruction projects over the last twenty two years with no maintenance in between! We do not have a maintenance culture in Uganda -there is more money in kickbacks to be made from reconstruction projects than from maintenance. We are a bit like those beggars on the street -the more miserable we look, the more we are likely to get millions of dollars to spend on building mansions with no access roads in the name of reconstruction! As for servicing the debts from those "grants" and reconstruction loans, "abazukulu balilabileeyo"!!!

A nine year old who was visiting Uganda for the first time since he was three after driving down Wakaliga road which has the worlds highest number of humps, (not sure where the engineer who designed it got his degree from) asked me why Ugandan roads needed humps!!! In his nine year old wisdom, he failed to see why roads with so many potholes needed humps for peed control for the way he saw it, there were more potholes than road surface! i must say i couldn't fault him and i now wonder why you cannot ee something that is so obvious to a nine year old!!!

Trust me unless you are comparing yourself with Congo or Somalia, Uganda even in Africa has some of the worst roads!

You are free to comment or not to comment on the subject! I do know that you ae being dishonest. i know for a fact that you have been to Asia and europe but I will not insist on those. I know that you have been to Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe and probably South Africa! As far as roads and road maintenance goes, Uganda is in a very bad place! When you are in Europe, Australia or America on could think that Zimbabwe has the worst roads in Africa! Before I travelled to Zimbabwe, many white people told me the roads were really bad and full of potholes! After travelling to Zimbabwe,and driving on their roads and those of Kampala, am now embarrassed to compare their roads to our own! If Harare has potholes, then calling Uganda's roads pot holed is an insult to potholes! we should find another word to describe them!

Anyone who has driven on Kampala's roads particularly someone who has travelled to other countries has got to be dishonest to award any marks for road maintenance!

P.S ;I have driven on Namugongo road and i really pity you if thats what you call a good and well maintained road!!!
