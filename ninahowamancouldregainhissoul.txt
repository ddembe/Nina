Nina, in 1986, it looked like we were on our way to regaining our soul.

In 2011, its clear that w are on our way to losing it.

But there's one man who could make the difference between us losing our soul and regaining it -by making the ultimate sacrifice and giving up that which he obviously holds most dear -power!

Mandela set the standard for SA when he unlike other 'revolutionary" leaders like Mugabe, Museveni, Aferwaki, etc, gave up power voluntarily and took up his place as a statesman.

In this we are not talking about giving up power to the son, wife, brother, in -law or crony.

Museveni has got the unique opportunity to create history in Uganda -giving up power without waiting for his arse to be kicked and retiring within his own country. Its only then that he will have regained his soul which he lost a long time ago. Power appears to be his only drive and motivation. But of course he has the option of following in the footsteps of other life presidents who didnt quite realise their dream of ruling for their natural life and watched their lifes work crumble around them.

It is not illegal or immoral for sons and daughters to play a part in their fathers government. But its a mistake to mistake priviledge for ability or acumen, opportunity for a right or entitlement.

While equality and equal opportunity are dreams largely unattainable for most, the ideal is a meritocracy in which ability is rewarded and put to work in the service of the nation not nepotism determining who are the leaders and who are the led!
